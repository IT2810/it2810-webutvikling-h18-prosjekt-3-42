It still wont work on some phones, but there doesn't seem to be anything we can do about it. I turned on high precision mode location service, turned it off, restarted the phone, turned on location service again and then it worked.

npm audit fix doesn't fix some vulnerabilities, but it is being worked on by smart people https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/21769

## App functionality and choices
The app we have made for this assignment is a todo-app that allows for much more advance tracking and sorting of the things you need to do, than your standard todo-app.
To add a new todo, you start by pressing the green +-button at the bottom left of the screen.


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/htMp5WW.jpg" alt="new todo" width="80px"/>

You are then taken to a page that allows you to add a new todo

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cHuWQBu.jpg" width="200px" />

Here, you can enter a name for the todo, a description, as well as a location for where the todo will take place. This location can be an address "Storgata 1, Oslo", a place "Rema 1000 Elgeseter", or just a place name "Trondheim" or "Sweden". After typing in your desired location, remember to push the ðŸ”Ž-icon in the searchbar. You can also set a priority for your todo that is either low, medium or high.
After saving your todo,  you will be taken back to the main page, where your todo will be displayed, ready for sorting or completing.

The distance-field in the todo shows how far your current location is from the todo-location, so that you can sort your todos by which is closest. You can also sort on date, title, priority as well as when they were created. The pen icon allows you to edit your todo, as well as set it to completed. Completed todos will be moved to the bottom of the list, and the progress bar at the top will reflect how many of your active todos are completed.

The map-button at the bottom of the screen, allows you to see your todos on a map.

## Technology
### React Native
React Native was used to develop our app. This allowed for easy cross-platform development, using JavaScript and syntax that is very close to what you would use in web-development. JavaScript is a language all the group members were competent in from before, so the time spent on learning was minimized and development and planning could begin at the start of the assignment. Due to the short timeframe of this assignment, the use of react-native was very helpful in allowing us to get a working app up and running in the time frame that was expected of us, and the lessons learned from the previous assignment, could be applied to this assigment as well.
### Expo
[Expo](https://expo.io/)  is a toolchain that allows for easy development of cross-platform react-native apps. It also contains many useful components and APIs that allows use of native platform functionality. A number of these were used in this project, specifically the location API, the maps API and the permissions API. This will be further explained in the location part of the [Tutorials-section](#location)

## Work Methodology
### Git
We used Git to facility collaborative coding, as well as tracking features that need to be implemented and bugs that needed to be fixed. Branches were created for new features or large changes to existing features, form which pull requests were created. Another member of the group would then conduct a review of the code, before approving the pull request.

Commits were marked with issues so that it would be easy to see what was done in each commit. The use of issues also made it easy to distribute and assign tasks to group members and to get an overview of the work that was left.  

### Group work
In general, most of the coding was done through pair programming. This workflow worked well for our group. When this was not possible, code reviews were done through pull requests, to make sure that the code committed to master worked and didn't break any of the existing functionality, so that we always had a working version in the master-branch.

## Third party libraries
### react-native-paper
[react-native-paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) was used to get a cohesive look in the app, with designed components that follow Material Design guidelines, that is made to work cross-platform. Use of this library therefore made supporting both iOS and Android easier, as we could be sure that buttons, text inputs etc. would look the same and work the same across platforms.
### react-navigation
[react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) was used to implement functionality for routing and navigating between the different screens in our app. This library allowed us to send props between screens, as well as an easy way to define navigation between screens with back buttons etc. Use of this library will be further described in the [Tutorials-section](#react-navigation).
### expo
As mentioned above, and in closer detail in the tutorials section below, a couple of the expo APIs were used to extend the functionality of our app with native functionality to the platform. The location API was used to lookup the GPS-coordinates of the users current location, as well as a functionality for geocoding an address to find it's coordinates. These two sets of coordinates could then be used to find the distance between the users current location and the todo-location.

To be allowed access to the users location, the permissions API in expo was used to get the location permission.

To display the todos on a map, the map API in Expo was used. This API will use either Google Maps or Apple Maps depending on the platform used.

## Tutorials
### react-navigation
Navigation 

First of all you need to install react-navigation.
```javascript
npm install --save react-navigation
```

To use the navigator we need to define an initialRouteName and its route. In this example we have Home as the only route and the initialRouteName. This means that HomeScreen is our homescreen, but we can't navigate to any other parts of the application yet as they don't exist.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import HomeScreen from 'HomeScreen'
import { createStackNavigator } form 'react-navigation';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <RootStack />
  }
}

const RootStack = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Home: HomeScreen,
  },
  {
    initialRouteName: "Home",
  }
)

```
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import SecondScreen from 'SecondSCreen'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return() {
      <View>
        <Text>
          Sample text
        </Text>
      </View>
    }
  }
}
```

If we want to navigate to another part of the application we need to use call the navigator and where we want to navigate to. Note that if we navigate to a place which is not possible or not defined nothing happens. In our HomeScreen component we have added a button which navigates us to SecondScreen. This SecondScreen is also defined in the RootStack such that we can navigate to it. In SecondScreen we have a button which allows us to go back to the previous screen. In this case that will be HomeScreen, but it can be more powerful than that if used more creatively. 

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import HomeScreen from 'HomeScreen'
import SecondScreen from 'SecondSCreen'
import { createStackNavigator } form 'react-navigation';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <RootStack />
  }
}

const RootStack = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Home: HomeScreen,
    SecondScreen: SecondScreen
  },
  {
     initialRouteName: "Home",
  }
)

```
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import SecondScreen from 'SecondSCreen'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

export default class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return() {
      <View>
        <Text>
	  Sample text
	</Text>
	<Button onPress={() => this.props.navigation.navigate("SecondScreen")})>
	  ButtonText
	</Button>
      </View>
    }
  }
}
```
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default class SecondScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return() {
      <View>
        <Text>
	  Other text
        </Text>
	<Button onPress={() => this.props.navigation.goBack}>
	  Go back to HomeScreen
	</Button>
      </View>
    }
  }
}
```

### Location
Map tutorial

The map itself comes from expo. To use it you need to import it from expo and probide the required props latitude, longitude, latitudeDelta and longitudeDelta.

```javascript
import { MapView } from "expo";

export default class MapTest() {
  render() {
    return
      <MapView
        initialRegion={{
	  latitude: 63.42,
	  longitude: 10.4,
	  latitudeDelta: 0.09,
	  longitudeDelta: 0.04,
	}}
      >
      </MapView>
      }
}
```

This will put the map in Trondheim at GlÃ¸shaugen.

To add marker to the map we need to use the MapView as a marker and provide it with coordinates, a title, a key and a description.


```javascript
import { MapView } from "expo";

const Marker = MapView

let marker = <Marker coordinate={{latitude: 63.40, longitude:10.35}} 
  title={"Title"} description={"Description"} />

export default class MapTest() {
 render() {
  return <MapView
   initialRegion={{
    latitude: 63.42,
    longitude: 10.4,
    latitudeDelta: 0.09,
    longitudeDelta: 0.04,
   }}
   >
  </MapView>
  }
}
```

If you want multiple markers you need to save multiple
```javascript
import { MapView } from "expo";

const Marker = MapView

let markerData = [{coordinate:{latitude: 63.4, longitude: 10.35}, key:new Date().getTime().toString(), 
  title:"Title1", description:"Description1"},
  {coordinate:{latitude: 63.37, longitude: 10.37}, key:((new Date().getTime() + 1).toString()), 
  title:"Title2", description:"Description2"},
  {coordinate:{latitude: 63.42, longitude: 10.37}, key:((new Date().getTime() + 2).toString()), 
  title:"Title3", description:"Description3"}
]


export default class MapTest() {
  render() {
    let markers = markerData
    .map(x => (
      <Marker
        coordinate={x.coordinate}
        title={x.title}
        key={x.key}
        description={x.description}
      />
      ))
      return
        <MapView
          initialRegion={{
            latitude: 63.42,
            longitude: 10.4,
            latitudeDelta: 0.09,
            longitudeDelta: 0.04,
          }}
        >
          {markers}
        </MapView>
      }
}
```

### AsyncStorage

[The code we used is slightly modified version of this code](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage.html)
To store and retrieve data we used AsyncStorage. For saving we used the AsyncStorage.setItem function to try to save a stringified version of out todos in our state.

```javascript
// HomeScreen
import { AsyncStorage } from "react-native";

...

_storeData = async () => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(this.state.todos));
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("Store data error" + error);
  }
};
```
For retrieving the data used the AsyncStorage.getItem function to try to get the item. If it is not null we set update state with our newly found todos, else we do nothing as no todos are found

```javascript
// HomeScreen
import { AsyncStorage } from "react-native";

...

_retrieveData = async () => {
  try {
    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem("todos");
      if (value !== null) {
        this.setState({ todos: JSON.parse(value) });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("Retrieve data error" + error);
  }
};
```


## Testing
### Jest
Jest was used to unit test important functionality in our code. Elements in the app that change appearance or content based on props (specifically components relating to the todos) were tested with snapshots, and functions such as mathematical functions (haversine and toRadians) as well as our sorting functions were tested to check that they produced the desired output.

```
PASS  __tests__/functions.test.js
 Test helper functions in functions.js
   âˆš toRadians should correctly convert degrees (6ms)
   âˆš Haversine should correctly find distance between two sets of coordinates (1ms)
 Test sorting functions, in functions.js
   âˆš sortKey should put earliest key on top (2ms)
   âˆš sortTitle should sort todos alphabetically
   âˆš sortDate should put earliest date on top (2ms)
   âˆš sortPriority should put highest date on top

PASS  __tests__/Todo.test.js
 Test ToDoTitle component
   âˆš ToDoTitle snapshot test (6ms)
   âˆš Todo title should be in ToDoTitle
   âˆš Todo date should match date in ToDoTitle (1ms)
   âˆš Todo completed status should match in ToDoTitle (1ms)
 Test ToDoContent component
   âˆš Todo description should match description in ToDoContent
   âˆš ToDoContent distance should match distance between currentLocation and todo-location
```
### Android
The app has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S8 and a Huawei Honor 8, and all functionality is working as expected.
### iOS
Due to no members of the group having access to an iOS device, or a device that can run an iPhone emulator, we have not been able to test the app on iOS. But, most or all of the functionality should work as expected on iOS-devices as well.

The only component we are using that is Android-specific is the DatePickerAndroid from react-native. Therefore we also implemented code for DatePickerIOS, but have not been able to test if this is working as expected.
